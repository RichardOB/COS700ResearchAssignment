\begin{abstract}
The abstract should summarize the contents of the paper and should
contain at least 70 and at most 150 words. It should be written using the
\emph{abstract} environment. Content includes 1) a brief background to the research (no citations) and
a problem statement, 2) Method(s) used, 3) Expected Results. This is usually easier to write last and
should not be just a cut and paste from the proposal - write it in a more condensed form.

\section{Introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Introduce the background against which your research will be conducted.
  \item Aim is to convince the reader
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item That the research is relevant, necessary and timely.
   \item That the research has not been done.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item What to put in the introduction:
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item Start with broad field into which your research falls
   \item Become more specific
   \item Lead into the problem statement
   \item Use references throughout (But it is not the full literature survey).
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Example Project: Multicasting of Multimedia via a metropolitan area Network
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item Could start with a statement about how the use of multimedia data has increased
   \item Then move onto the high bandwidth requirements of multimedia data and some ways multimedia data is communicated
   \item Outline the shortcomings of existing approaches
   \item Introduce multicasting and metropolitan area networks
   \item Summarize some of the relevant existing work
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Problem Statement}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Describe the problem that your research will address in as much detail as possible.
 \item Stating your title as a question sometime helps in naming the problem.
 \item Specify and describe your main objectives and sub-objectives.
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item to demonstrate ...
  \item to evaluate ...
  \item todetermine ...
  \item to establish ...
  \item to argue ...
  \item to prove ...
  \item etc
 \end{enumerate}
  \item Define the scope and limitations of the research
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item What your work deals with and what it does not deal with
   \item ``This work does not consider...''
  \end{enumerate}
  \item State any assumptions that you are aware of.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methodology}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Identify the methods that you plan to use to address your objectives. \footnote{Refer back to Lecture 3 handout}
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Which paradigms and tools?
  \item What code do you expect to write?
  \item What experiments will you need to conduct? (Briefly outline)
 \end{enumerate}
 \item Must tie back to your research objectives.
 \item Should be clear that methods are appropriate \footnote{Explain why alternative methods are not proposed}

\end{enumerate}


\section{Literature Survey}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Give an overview of research that has been conducted on the problem you are investigating.\footnote{See Lecture 2}
 \item Only use published references
 \item Work should be directly linked to your work. \footnote{You must point out this link}
 \item Objective: To show how your research relates to and differs from existing research.
 \item Identify the main players in the field.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Project Planning}

\begin{enumerate}

 \item Identify and describe the specific phases of your work
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Such as reading, writing, coding, experimentation, testing, writing, editing, writing.
 \end{enumerate}
 
 \item Provide a schedule of everything that needs to be done all the way up to the submission date (5 November) or Presentation Date
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Tasks that need to be done and the time allocated to them with deadlines.
  \item Remember that your supervisor needs time to review your report/paper and you need time to incorporate changes before the submission date.
 \end{enumerate}
 
 \item Advantages of Task Timelines:
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Forces you to break down the work into manageable chunks.
  \item Lets you think about the logical sequence of tasks.
  \item Planning helps you to not miss out important tasks.
  \item Creates deadlines for yourself.
  \item Clears your head
  \item Can be used to map progress.
 \end{enumerate}
 
 \item Some Hints:
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Be realistic, rather pad the time than set unrealistic deadlines.
  \item Don't forget to factor in other things (other modules, your life, ...)
  \item Some tasks can run concurrently - good to have alternative tasks to work on.
  \item Give page estimates to writing tasks.
  \item Start from end and plan backwards.
  \item Commit to your plan: have your timeline visible somewhere
  \item Update your plan if necessary as you progress through the work.
 \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
